# COMP9417_Project
## pre_processing.py
This file will extract features from dataset and generate two .csv files:
    1. paper_feature.csv
    2. all_features.csv
The first one contains the features found useful in the paper given in the dataset for this assignment.
The second one contains not only the features used in the study, but also some features we think might be helpful.
Both of them are already placed in this folder as well.

## models.py
This file contains the codes of our models and will take the two feature sets generated above as input for the models we built.
